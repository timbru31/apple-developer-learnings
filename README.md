# The road to publish an app to the App Store üò£

This is a collection of loose things that I (we) learnt the hard way.  
Most of them are difficult to find, to understand and not obvious.

I hope to save some headache for other people who want to publish an app.

## Organization ‚ùóÔ∏è= Enterprise account

Apple differentiates three types of developer accounts for business (excluding education and MFi):

* Individuals
* Organizations
* Enterprise Program

The most important thing: Enterprise accounts **can not publish in the App Store**. They can only distribute via In-house App Distribution.  
This means *BYOD* (bring your own device) is impossible, if the customer should be able to download the app from the App Store.

### More information

Apple has indeed a page that compares the different memberships. It's clearly stated, but not easy to find.
It's located here: https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/
